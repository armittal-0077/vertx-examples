= Vert.x Service Resolver examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating Vert.x Service Resolver

The Vert.x service resolver is a plugin that lets Vert.x clients call services using logical service names instead of network addresses. The service resolver is also able to perform client side load balancing.

In both examples, the default load balancer is round-robin, you can configure a different load balancer if you like.

== Consul DNS example

This example demonstrates how to configure the Vert.x HTTP client to resolve service address against a Consul
server using DNS.

== Custom mapping

This example demonstrates how to configure the Vert.x HTTP client to resolve service address using a custom mapping, i.e.
a function that returns a list of socket addresses given a service name.
